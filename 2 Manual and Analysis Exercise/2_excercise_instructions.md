**Write the list of test cases to cover the functionality of a pet store backend service** [Swagger UI](https://petstore.swagger.io/#/), **Pet section.**

Please define the list of test cases to cover the functionality of all the endpoints in the Pet section of the pet store backend service. You can assume that it is working as expected. It is not needed for you to provide the json files (schemas, requests or responses) in the analysis. Those files are already in the swagger and they work as the needed documentation. You can use any methodology you want.
