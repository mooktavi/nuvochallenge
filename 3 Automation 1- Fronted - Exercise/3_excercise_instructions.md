Analyze it and make any changes you may think of to make it clearer and more readable. Explain your changes.

Create an automation test for the final scenario/s you defined using Selenium Webdriver and Java or whatever language you prefer.

The goal of this test is to check if you are able to detect faults in the given specifications and also if you are able to automate a test of a given website. We'd like you to also demonstrate the coding quality and structure and style of the deliverables. The required reporting is the console output, but having a nicer reporting (HTML, hit an API, XML...) is a plus.

Please simplify / document as much as possible the setup of your deliverable assuming we would run the tests in a local machine If you deliver the code using a public code repository (e.g. github):

Push your new repository into your account and make it private.

Send us the links to your repository, so that we can review it
